            Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.

            For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.

            Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) represent two groundbreaking fields that are reshaping the way we interact with technology and the world around us. The convergence of robotics and AI has led to the development of intelligent robots that can adapt to different situations, learn from their environment, and execute tasks with precision, opening up new possibilities across industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, and more.

            In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.          </span>
